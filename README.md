# 🎯 Gabut Coding Lab 🧪

> _"Because being 'gabut' is productive, and learning is fun!"_ 😄

Welcome to **Gabut Coding Lab** - where boredom meets creativity, and coding becomes an exciting adventure! 🚀

## 🌟 What is this?

This is my **personal laboratory** where I (Verrel) explore the coding world with the spirit of "gabut but productive". Every project here is the result of high curiosity and the desire to learn new things. From simple to complex, everything is here!

_P.S: The name "gabut" was chosen not because of laziness, but because these are projects made during free time to fill boredom with something beneficial!_ 😉

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

### 💡 **"Learn by Building"**

Every project is built with a hands-on approach. No boring theory, just practice and experimentation!

### 🔄 **"Iterate and Improve"**

Nothing is perfect from the start. Every project continues to be developed and improved as knowledge grows.

### 🎨 **"Make it Beautiful"**

Good code is important, but attractive UI/UX is equally important. User experience is the priority!

### 🚀 **"Stay Updated"**

Technology evolves quickly, so always try the latest frameworks and libraries. React 19? Next.js 14? Let's go!
